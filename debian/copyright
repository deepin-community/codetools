This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-codetools package of codetools, a
collection of functions for code analysis for R. Codetools was written
by Luke Tierney.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>. The
sources were downloaded with the R 2.5.0 upstream sources. Sources for
codetools are available at CRAN at its mirrors at 
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/
as well as with R releases at
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/base/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'codetools' to
'r-cran-codetools' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages
for R.
